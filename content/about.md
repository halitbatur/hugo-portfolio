## Hey there! My name is Halit Batur

I became interested in coding in my first year of university when I
was studying Computer Engineering. At that time, I started learning
C and C++. However, due to certain circumstances, I had to change my
major to Industrial Engineering. In March 2020, I got a chance to
join [Re:Coded](https://www.re-coded.com/) Front End Web Development Bootcamp. Education took 5 months and it
was a hard and interesting time. Upon my graduation from the
program, I became familiar with a lot of technologies like React, Redux, Firebase and much more!

Currently I'm working at [Re:Coded](https://www.re-coded.com/) as a Trainer to help people who are passionate about learning how to code, and pass
everything that I have learned in my journey to them.
